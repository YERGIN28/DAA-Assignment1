# Assignment 1 â€“ Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Implementation of classic Divide & Conquer algorithms:
- **MergeSort** (with reusable buffer and small-n cutoff)
- **QuickSort** (randomized pivot, recursion on the smaller partition)
- **Deterministic Select** (Median of Medians)
- **Closest Pair of Points** (2D)

Additionally: metrics, tests, report, and CI.
